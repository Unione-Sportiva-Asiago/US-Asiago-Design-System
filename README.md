# Our own personal space for _everything_ digital: welcome to the Unione Sportiva Asiago's digital team page :rocket:

Hi! We are the team behind the website and the design sistem of the Unione Sportiva Asiago. In this repository you will find **_all_** the documentation that we've used to style and build our new website, togheter with the Design System. :raised_hands:

For more information about the licence and the documents we've taken ideas from, please refer to `Licensing and attributions` section.

## Introduction
When we started design our new website, we asked ourselves: "Is it possible to build a product that embodies our soul, while being modern and simple to use?" 
That's why we started from scratch and decided to create **our own Design System** on which the website would be based.

Having a Design System is a key part of building a website, since it:
- Helps maintaining **consistency** throughout the entire project
- Gives us guidelines to follow when thinking of new digital interfaces
- Makes us **uniquely recognizable** out there in the world

## How did we build Unione Sportiva Asiago's Design System?
