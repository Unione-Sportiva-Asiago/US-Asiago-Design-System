Hi! We are the team behind the website and the design sistem of the Unione Sportiva Asiago. In this repository you will find **_all_** the documentation that we've used to style and build our new website, together with the Design System. :raised_hands:

## Introduction
When we started design our new website, we asked ourselves: "Is it possible to build a product that embodies our soul, while being modern and simple to use?" 
That's why we started from scratch and decided to create **our own Design System** on which the website would be based.

Having a Design System is a key part of building a website, since it:
- Helps maintaining **consistency** throughout the entire project
- Gives us guidelines to follow when thinking of new digital interfaces
- Makes us **uniquely recognizable** out there in the world

## How did we build Unione Sportiva Asiago's Design System?
1. We started by analizing the story of our club and we searched for the right colour palette, the one that could help us communicate efficenty our goals and our story. So we opened our wardrobe and looked at our beautiful jacket, made with these beautiful colours:

<!-- Inserisci immagine blu, rosso e giallo-->

2. Then we've added some complementary colours that goes along well with the other ones, red and yellow particularly:

<!-- Immagine altri colori-->

3. Finally, we closed the PC and went for a ski with the whole team. It's then that we found out that we wanted to convey the uniqueness of every athlete and the sense of family that you can find when you're part of the Team USA. So we've added some shapes - some with sharp angles and some with round corners - to express these last particulars.

The result? A unique and distinctive Design System that mix together our centenary story and today's reality in the team. Something that wants to express the way you will feel if you come ski with us.

- The _Carbon Design System_ by IBM, the open source Design System adopted by the technological company IBM across their websites and services.
- The _Country's Design System_ developed by [Designers Italia](https://designers.italia.it), an ambitious project from AGiD and the DTD, the Italian Department for Digital Transition, which aim is to develop better interfaces for digital public services of the future.
- _Sirio_, @INPS-it's Design System which is the basis for the new INPS website. INPS, Istituto Nazionale di Previdenza Sociale, is the government's entity that distributes all the government's bonuses and a range of different services, and it's website is one of the most visited in Italy.
