# Icons
We've personally designed a set of icons, tailor made to our needs and our Brand Identity.
These icons present slightly rounded borders and a modern design that goues on well with the complessive economy of the website and the social media posts' design.

The goal is the same: convey the idea that we are a family where you can have a lot of fun (the rounded borders) but that can be serious when needed (the sharp borders).
