# Grids
What are grids? That's an intresting questions.

Grids are a kind of canvas that we can use to determine how big an element will look like on different devices. They are really helpfulf when building a new website, as you will be able to make your website responsive.

Our Grids are based on the ones used by _Designers Italia_: nothing more, just reused information! âœ¨
