# Typography
In our Design System, we've chosen to use well established fonts, that are proven to be accessible and easy to read for everyone, but also stylish and appealing to our tone of voice.

That's why our official fonts are `Ubuntu` and `Titillium Web`:
- `Ubuntu` is a font developed by Dalto Maag with funding by Canonical Ltd and, as you may notice from the name, it is the official font of the Ubuntu OS. This font is considered [clear and accessible both in print and online content](https://media.specialolympics.org/resources/brand-awareness-and-communication/branding/tools-and-templates/Ubuntu-Guide.pdf).
- `Titillium Web` is the font chosen by Designer Italia for the Guidelines for Public Administration's websites since it is accesible and easy to read. You can find out more on [Docs Italia](https://docs.italia.it/italia/designers-italia/design-linee-guida-docs/it/stabile/doc/introduzione-linee-guida-design.html).
