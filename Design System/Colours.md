# Colours
For our colour palette, we wanted to choose something that could convey our story and our passion for the snow.
That's why the first two colours, `Vivid Burgundy` and `Bright Yellow Crayola` are quite the same that we wear on our jacket.

The other ones are all modifications of the base colour, `Bright Navy Blue`. Altogether, these colours make great combinations when put together, creating a distinctive Brand Identity that makes us uniquely recognizable.
